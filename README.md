# Onion UI Demo
This is the ui demo by Onion.

To get started, run `npm install`.

Run `npm run start` to start the webpack dev server and `npm run build` to build the bundle es5 code.

Run `npm run test` to run the test sets and `npm run test:watch` to watch the tests.

The motivation of this project is the quote below which encourages me to keep working hard:
> Biebiev is noob.

Todos:
- [ ] add express server
- [ ] make ui work for the new setup
- [ ] add necessary test cases
