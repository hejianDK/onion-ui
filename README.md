# Onion UI Demo
This is the ui demo by Onion.

To get started, run `npm install`.

Run `npm run start` to start the webpack dev server and `npm run build` to build the bundle es5 code.

Run `npm run test` to run the test sets and `npm run test:watch` to watch the tests.

Run `npm run lint` to check the JavaScript style using Airbnb rule.

All JavaScript codes in app folder passed eslint check and all tests passed before commit.

The motivation of this project is the quote below which encourages me to keep working hard:
> Biebiev is noob.

Todos:
- [x] add express server
- [ ] make ui work for the new setup
- [ ] add necessary test cases
- [ ] add sass supports
- [x] add mongodb/postgress as database
